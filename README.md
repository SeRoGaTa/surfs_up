# Surfs Up

***Version 1.0.0***

---

## Overview of Project
#### This report has the objective to give a clear information to W. Avy about Oahu temperatures across the year (sampling June and December) to see if the opening of the Surf and Ice Cream Shops are good business all year long

#### This report has 2 parts 

1. The summary and statistical information from the month of June.
2. The summary and statistical information from the month of December.


## Results

#### From the results this report got from the temperatures of June and December we can summarize 4 points

1. There are more data from June than December (183 more registers) but is the 10% less than December so shouldn't move the decision.
2. There is barely any change between the mean temp from June to Dec (~4°) so the shops could behave the same way all year long.
3. The minimum temperature from December is way lower than in June (~8°) telling us that there might be some days that could affect but in overall the stats looks very similar.
4. The range from max to min temps between both months vary in 27% so we should see a very small drop in December.

This is the stats table from Jun and Dec

## Summary
#### After this analysis we could summarize the following.

- The data doesn't change in a huge way between the middle and end of the year so the behavior of the customers shouldn't change that much across the year.
- The big difference we could see is a drop of 27% in a Temp between these months that might be cooler nights or mornings but if we adjust the opening and closing hours from the shops, we could absorb these variations.

In Summary we support a go for the shops opening based on the shown data
